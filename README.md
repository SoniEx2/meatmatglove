# MeatMatGlove

Traditional motion capture gloves use various sensors embedded in a substrate
(usually fabric). These sensors are standard, mass produced sensors, yet their
cost still adds up.

The MeatMatGlove idea, on the other hand, attempts to do the same thing using a
more advanced kind of sensor. It is known that radiofrequency (RF) systems can
be used for bend sensing, as would be used for finger tracking. Such RF sensors
are much cheaper to manufacture than standard bend sensors. However, a
traditional motion capture glove would still use multiples of them.

In MeatMatGlove, the idea is to use a "single" sensor. Metamaterials are RF
systems that can manipulate RF energy and provide lensing and filtering
effects, as one might use for signal multiplexing. By combining multiple bend
sensors operating at slightly different frequencies with a metamaterial
multiplexer, it should be possible to make a glove where the singular sensing
element, that is, the entire glove, is a single sheet of plastic with a
metallic pattern printed on it, effectively using a printed circuit board
manufacturing process, which is extremely cheap (think less than one US dollar
per glove).

Granted, this still needs an active element to make the sensor work. A basic
RF development platform costs around 200 to 300 US dollars today. This is much
cheaper than the cheapest motion capture gloves on the market today, but it's
still pretty expensive. However, that's the cost of the development platform,
not of the final product. It's safe to assume the final product would be
cheaper.
